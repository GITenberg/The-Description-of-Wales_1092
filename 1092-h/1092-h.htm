<h1><span class="smcap">The Description of Wales</span><br />
by<br />
Gerald of Wales</h1>
<h2><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>FIRST PREFACE<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TO STEPHEN LANGTON, ARCHBISHOP OF
CANTERBURY</span></h2>
<p>I, <span class="smcap">who</span>, at the expense of three
years&rsquo; labour, arranged, a short time ago, in three parts,
the Topography of Ireland, with a description of its natural
curiosities, and who afterwards, by two years&rsquo; study,
completed in two parts the Vaticinal History of its Conquest; and
who, by publishing the Itinerary of the Holy Man (Baldwin)
through Cambria, prevented his laborious mission from perishing
in obscurity, do now propose, in the present little work, to give
some account of this my native country, and to describe the
genius of its inhabitants, so entirely distinct from that of
other nations.&nbsp; And this production of my industry I have
determined to dedicate to you, illustrious Stephen, archbishop of
Canterbury, as I before ascribed to you my Itinerary; considering
you as a man no less distinguished by your piety, than
conspicuous for your learning; though so humble an offering may
possibly be unworthy the acceptance of a personage who, from his
eminence, deserves to be presented with works of the greatest
merit.</p>
<p>Some, indeed, object to this my undertaking, and, apparently
from motives of affection, compare me to a painter, who, rich in
colours, and like another Zeuxis, eminent in his art, is
endeavouring with all his skill and industry to give celebrity to
a cottage, or to some other contemptible object, whilst the world
is anxiously expecting from his hand a temple or a palace.&nbsp;
Thus they wonder that I, amidst the many great and striking
subjects <a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>which the world presents, should choose to describe and
to adorn, with all the graces of composition, such remote corners
of the earth as Ireland and Wales.</p>
<p>Others again, reproaching me with greater severity, say, that
the gifts which have been bestowed upon me from above, ought not
to be wasted upon these insignificant objects, nor lavished in a
vain display of learning on the commendation of princes, who,
from their ignorance and want of liberality, have neither taste
to appreciate, nor hearts to remunerate literary
excellence.&nbsp; And they further add, that every faculty which
emanates from the Deity, ought rather to be applied to the
illustration of celestial objects, and to the exultation of his
glory, from whose abundance all our talents have been received;
every faculty (say they) ought to be employed in praising him
from whom, as from a perennial source, every perfect gift is
derived, and from whose bounty everything which is offered with
sincerity obtains an ample reward.&nbsp; But since excellent
histories of other countries have been composed and published by
writers of eminence, I have been induced, by the love I bear to
my country and to posterity, to believe that I should perform
neither an useless nor an unacceptable service, were I to unfold
the hidden merits of my native land; to rescue from obscurity
those glorious actions which have been hitherto imperfectly
described, and to bring into repute, by my method of treating it,
a subject till now regarded as contemptible.</p>
<p>What indeed could my feeble and unexercised efforts add to the
histories of the destruction of Troy, Thebes, or Athens, or to
the conquest of the shores of Latium?&nbsp; Besides, to do what
has been already done, is, in fact, to be doing nothing; I have,
therefore, thought it more eligible to apply my industry to the
arrangement of the history of my native country, hitherto almost
wholly overlooked by strangers; but interesting to my relations
and countrymen; and from these small beginnings to aspire by
degrees to works of a nobler cast.&nbsp; <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>From these
inconsiderable attempts, some idea may be formed with what
success, should Fortune afford an opportunity, I am likely to
treat matters of greater importance.&nbsp; For although some
things should be made our principal objects, whilst others ought
not to be wholly neglected, I may surely be allowed to exercise
the powers of my youth, as yet untaught and unexperienced, in
pursuits of this latter nature, lest by habit I should feel a
pleasure in indolence and in sloth, the parent of vice.</p>
<p>I have therefore employed these studies as a kind of
introduction to the glorious treasures of that most excellent of
the sciences, which alone deserves the name of science; which
alone can render us wise to rule and to instruct mankind; which
alone the other sciences follow, as attendants do their
queen.&nbsp; Laying therefore in my youth the foundations of so
noble a structure, it is my intention, if God will assist me and
prolong my life, to reserve my maturer years for composing a
treatise upon so perfect, so sacred a subject: for according to
the poet,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Ardua quippe
fides robustos exigit annos;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;The important concerns of
faith require a mind in its full vigour;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I may be permitted to indulge myself for a short time in other
pursuits; but in this I should wish not only to continue, but to
die.</p>
<p>But before I enter on this important subject, I demand a short
interval, to enable me to lay before the public my Treatise on
the Instruction of a Prince, which has been so frequently
promised, as well as the Description of Wales, which is now
before me, and the Topography of Britain.</p>
<p>Of all the British writers, Gildas alone appears to me (as
often as the course of my subject leads me to consult him) worthy
of imitation; for by committing to paper the things which he
himself saw and knew, and by declaring rather than describing the
desolation of his <a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>country, he has compiled a history more remarkable for
its truth than for its elegance.</p>
<p>Giraldus therefore follows Gildas, whom he wishes he could
copy in his life and manners; becoming an imitator of his wisdom
rather than of his eloquence&mdash;of his mind rather than of his
writings&mdash;of his zeal rather than of his style&mdash;of his
life rather than of his language.</p>
<h2><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>SECOND PREFACE<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TO THE SAME</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span>, amidst various literary
pursuits, I first applied my mind to the compilation of history,
I determined, lest I should appear ungrateful to my native land,
to describe, to the best of my abilities, my own country and its
adjoining regions; and afterwards, under God&rsquo;s guidance, to
proceed to a description of more distant territories.&nbsp; But
since some leading men (whom we have both seen and known) show so
great a contempt for literature, that they immediately shut up
within their book-cases the excellent works with which they are
presented, and thus doom them, as it were, to a perpetual
imprisonment; I entreat you, illustrious Prelate, to prevent the
present little work, which will shortly be delivered to you, from
perishing in obscurity.&nbsp; And because this, as well as my
former productions, though of no transcendent merit, may
hereafter prove to many a source of entertainment and
instruction, I entreat you generously to order it to be made
public, by which it will acquire reputation.&nbsp; And I shall
consider myself sufficiently rewarded for my trouble, if,
withdrawing for a while from your religious and secular
occupations, you would kindly condescend to peruse this book, or,
at least, give it an attentive hearing; for in times like these,
when no one remunerates literary productions, I neither desire
nor expect any other recompense.&nbsp; Not that it would appear
in any way inconsistent, however there exists among men of rank a
kind of conspiracy against authors, if a prelate so eminently
conspicuous for his <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>virtues, for his abilities, both
natural and acquired, for irreproachable morals, and for
munificence, should distinguish himself likewise by becoming the
generous and sole patron of literature.&nbsp; To comprise your
merits in a few words, the lines of Martial addressed to Trajan,
whilst serving under Dioclesian, may be deservedly applied to
you:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Laudari debes quoniam sub principe duro,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Temporibusque malis, ausus es esse bonus.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And those also of Virgil to Mec&aelig;nas, which extol the
humanity of that great man:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Omnia cum possis tanto tam clarus amico,<br
/>
Te sensit nemo posse nocere tamen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many indeed remonstrate against my proceedings, and those
particularly who call themselves my friends insist that, in
consequence of my violent attachment to study, I pay no attention
to the concerns of the world, or to the interests of my family;
and that, on this account, I shall experience a delay in my
promotion to worldly dignities; that the influence of authors,
both poets and historians, has long since ceased; that the
respect paid to literature vanished with literary princes; and
that in these degenerate days very different paths lead to
honours and opulence.&nbsp; I allow all this, I readily allow it,
and acquiesce in the truth.&nbsp; For the unprincipled and
covetous attach themselves to the court, the churchmen to their
books, and the ambitious to the public offices, but as every man
is under the influence of some darling passion, so the love of
letters and the study of eloquence have from my infancy had for
me peculiar charms of attraction.&nbsp; Impelled by this thirst
for knowledge, I have carried my researches into the mysterious
works of nature farther than the generality of my contemporaries,
and for the benefit of posterity have rescued from oblivion the
remarkable events of my own times.&nbsp; But this object was not
to be secured without an indefatigable, <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>though at
the same time an agreeable, exertion; for an accurate
investigation of every particular is attended with much
difficulty.&nbsp; It is difficult to produce an orderly account
of the investigation and discovery of truth; it is difficult to
preserve from the beginning to the end a connected relation
unbroken by irrelevant matter; and it is difficult to render the
narration no less elegant in the diction, than instructive in its
matter, for in prosecuting the series of events, the choice of
happy expressions is equally perplexing, as the search after them
painful.&nbsp; Whatever is written requires the most intense
thought, and every expression should be carefully polished before
it be submitted to the public eye; for, by exposing itself to the
examination of the present and of future ages, it must
necessarily undergo the criticism not only of the acute, but also
of the dissatisfied, reader.&nbsp; Words merely uttered are soon
forgotten, and the admiration or disgust which they occasioned is
no more; but writings once published are never lost, and remain
as lasting memorials either of the glory or of the disgrace of
the author.&nbsp; Hence the observation of Seneca, that the
malicious attention of the envious reader dwells with no less
satisfaction on a faulty than on an elegant expression, and is as
anxious to discover what it may ridicule, as what it may commend;
as the poet also observes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Discit enim citius meminitque libentius
illud<br />
Quod quis deridet, quam quod probat et veneratur.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among the pursuits, therefore, most worthy of commendation,
this holds by no means the lowest rank; for history, as the moral
philosopher declares, &ldquo;is the record of antiquity, the
testimony of ages, the light of truth, the soul of memory, the
mistress of conduct, and the herald of ancient times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This study is the more delightful, as it is more honourable to
produce works worthy of being quoted than to quote the works of
others; as it is more desirable to be <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>the author of compositions which
deserve to be admired than to be esteemed a good judge of the
writings of other men; as it is more meritorious to be the just
object of other men&rsquo;s commendations than to be considered
an adept in pointing out the merits of others.&nbsp; On these
pleasing reflections I feed and regale myself; for I would rather
resemble Jerome than Croesus, and I prefer to riches themselves
the man who is capable of despising them.&nbsp; With these
gratifying ideas I rest contented and delighted, valuing
moderation more than intemperance, and an honourable sufficiency
more than superfluity; for intemperance and superfluity produce
their own destruction, but their opposite virtues never perish;
the former vanish, but the latter, like eternity, remain for
ever; in short, I prefer praise to lucre, and reputation to
riches.</p>

English is called Willow-forde, is four days&rsquo;
journey.&nbsp; It is a country very strongly defended by high
mountains, deep valleys, extensive woods, rivers, and marshes;
insomuch that from <a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>the time the Saxons took possession of the island the
remnants of the Britons, retiring into these regions, could never
be entirely subdued either by the English or by the
Normans.&nbsp; Those who inhabited the southern angle of the
island, which took its name from the chieftain Corin&aelig;us, <a
name="citation156"></a><a href="#footnote156"
class="citation">[156]</a> made less resistance, as their country
was more defenceless.&nbsp; The third division of the Britons,
who obtained a part of Britany in Gaul, were transported thither,
not after the defeat of their nation, but long before, by king
Maximus, and, in consequence of the hard and continued warfare
which they underwent with him, were rewarded by the royal
munificence with those districts in France.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THE ANCIENT DIVISION OF WALES INTO
THREE PARTS</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Wales</span> was in ancient times divided
into three parts nearly equal, consideration having been paid, in
this division, more to the value than to the just quantity or
proportion of territory.&nbsp; They were Venedotia, now called
North Wales; Demetia, or South Wales, which in British is called
Deheubarth, that is, the southern part; and Powys, the middle or
eastern district.&nbsp; Roderic the Great, or Rhodri Mawr, who
was king over all Wales, was the cause of this division.&nbsp; He
had three sons, Mervin, Anarawt, and Cadell, amongst whom he
partitioned the whole principality.&nbsp; North Wales fell to the
lot of Mervin; Powys to Anarawt; and Cadell received <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>the portion
of South Wales, together with the general good wishes of his
brothers and the people; for although this district greatly
exceeded the others in quantity, it was the least desirable from
the number of noble chiefs, or Uchelwyr, <a
name="citation157a"></a><a href="#footnote157a"
class="citation">[157a]</a> men of a superior rank, who inhabited
it, and were often rebellious to their lords, and impatient of
control.&nbsp; But Cadell, on the death of his brothers, obtained
the entire dominion of Wales, <a name="citation157b"></a><a
href="#footnote157b" class="citation">[157b]</a> as did his
successors till the time of Tewdwr, whose descendants, Rhys, son
of Tewdwr, Gruflydd, son of Rhys, and Rhys, son of Gruffydd, the
ruling prince in our time, enjoyed only (like the father) the
sovereignty over South Wales.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="GutSmall">GENEALOGY OF THE PRINCES OF
WALES</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following is the generation of
princes of South Wales: Rhys, son of Gruffydd; Gruffydd, son of
Rhys; Rhys, son of Tewdwr; Tewdwr, son of Eineon; Eineon, son of
Owen; Owen, son of Howel Dda, or Howel the Good; Howel, son of
Cadell, son of Roderic the Great.&nbsp; Thus the princes of South
Wales derived their origin from Cadell, son of Roderic the
Great.&nbsp; The princes of North Wales descended from Mervin in
this manner: Llewelyn, son of Iorwerth; Iorwerth, son of Owen;
Owen, son of Gruffydd; Gruffydd, son of Conan; Conan, son of
Iago; Iago, son of Edoual; Edoual, son of Meyric; Meyric, son of
Anarawt (Anandhrec); Anarawt, son of Mervin, son of Roderic the
Great.&nbsp; Anarawt leaving no issue, the princes of Powys have
their own particular descent.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark, that the Welsh bards and <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>singers, or
reciters, have the genealogies of the aforesaid princes, written
in the Welsh language, in their ancient and authentic books; and
also retain them in their memory from Roderic the Great to B.M.;
<a name="citation158a"></a><a href="#footnote158a"
class="citation">[158a]</a> and from thence to Sylvius, Ascanius,
and &AElig;neas; and from the latter produce the genealogical
series in a lineal descent, even to Adam.</p>
<p>But as an account of such long and remote genealogies may
appear to many persons trifling rather than historical, we have
purposely omitted them in our compendium.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HOW MANY CANTREDS, ROYAL PALACES, AND
CATHEDRALS THERE ARE IN WALES</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">South Wales</span> contains twenty-nine
cantreds; North Wales, twelve; Powys, six: many of which are at
this time in the possession of the English and Franks.&nbsp; For
the country now called Shropshire formerly belonged to Powys, and
the place where the castle of Shrewsbury stands bore the name of
Pengwern, or the head of the Alder Grove.&nbsp; There were three
royal seats in South Wales: Dinevor, in South Wales, removed from
Caerleon; Aberfraw, <a name="citation158b"></a><a
href="#footnote158b" class="citation">[158b]</a> in North Wales;
and Pengwern, in Powys.</p>
<p>Wales contains in all fifty-four cantreds.&nbsp; The word
<i>Cantref</i> is derived from <i>Cant</i>, a hundred, and
<i>Tref</i>, a village; <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>and means in the British and Irish
languages such a portion of land as contains a hundred vills.</p>
<p>There are four cathedral churches in Wales: St. David&rsquo;s,
upon the Irish sea, David the archbishop being its patron: it was
in ancient times the metropolitan church, and the district only
contained twenty-four cantreds, though at this time only
twenty-three; for Ergengl, in English called Urchenfeld, <a
name="citation159a"></a><a href="#footnote159a"
class="citation">[159a]</a> is said to have been formerly within
the diocese of St. David&rsquo;s, and sometimes was placed within
that of Landaff.&nbsp; The see of St. David&rsquo;s had
twenty-five successive archbishops; and from the time of the
removal of the pall into France, to this day, twenty-two bishops;
whose names and series, as well as the cause of the removal of
the archiepiscopal pall, may be seen in our Itinerary. <a
name="citation159b"></a><a href="#footnote159b"
class="citation">[159b]</a></p>
<p>In South Wales also is situated the bishopric of Landaff, near
the Severn sea, and near the noble castle of Caerdyf; bishop
Teilo being its patron.&nbsp; It contains five cantreds, and the
fourth part of another, namely, Senghennyd.</p>
<p>In North Wales, between Anglesey and the Eryri mountains, is
the see of Bangor, under the patronage of Daniel, the abbot; it
contains about nine cantreds.</p>
<p>In North Wales also is the poor little cathedral of Llan-Elwy,
or St. Asaph, containing about six cantreds, to which Powys is
subject.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THE TWO MOUNTAINS FROM WHICH THE NOBLE
RIVERS WHICH DIVIDE WALES SPRING</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Wales</span> is divided and distinguished
by noble rivers, which derive their source from two ranges of
mountains, <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>the Ellennith, in South Wales, which the English call
Moruge, as being the heads of moors, or bogs; and Eryri, in North
Wales, which they call Snowdon, or mountains of snow; the latter
of which are said to be of so great an extent, that if all the
herds in Wales were collected together, they would supply them
with pasture for a considerable time.&nbsp; Upon them are two
lakes, one of which has a floating island; and the other contains
fish having only one eye, as we have related in our
Itinerary.</p>
<p>We must also here remark, that at two places in Scotland, one
on the eastern, and the other on the western ocean, the sea-fish
called mulvelli (mullets) have only the right eye.</p>
<p>The noble river Severn takes its rise from the Ellennith
mountains, and flowing by the castles of Shrewsbury and
Bridgenorth, through the city of Worcester, and that of
Gloucester, celebrated for its iron manufactories, falls into the
sea a few miles from the latter place, and gives its name to the
Severn Sea.&nbsp; This river was for many years the boundary
between Cambria and Loegria, or Wales and England; it was called
in British Hafren, from the daughter of Locrinus, who was drowned
in it by her step-mother; the aspirate being changed, according
to the Latin idiom, into S, as is usual in words derived from the
Greek, it was termed Sarina, as hal becomes <i>sal</i>; hemi,
<i>semi</i>; hepta, <i>septem</i>.</p>
<p>The river Wye rises in the same mountains of Ellennith, and
flows by the castles of Hay and Clifford, through the city of
Hereford, by the castles of Wilton and Goodrich, through the
forest of Dean, abounding with iron and deer, and proceeds to
Strigul castle, below which it empties itself into the sea, and
forms in modern times the boundary between England and
Wales.&nbsp; The Usk does not derive its origin from these
mountains, but from those of Cantref Bachan; it flows by the
castle of Brecheinoc, or Aberhodni, that is, the fall of the
river Hodni into the Usk (for Aber, in the British language,
signifies every place where two rivers unite their <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>streams);
by the castles of Abergevenni and Usk, through the ancient city
of Legions, and discharges itself into the Severn Sea, not far
from Newport.</p>
<p>The river Remni flows towards the sea from the mountains of
Brecheinoc, having passed the castle and bridge of Remni.&nbsp;
From the same range of mountains springs the Taf, which pursues
its course to the episcopal see of Landaf (to which it gives its
name), and falls into the sea below the castle of Caerdyf.&nbsp;
The river Avon rushes impetuously from the mountains of
Glamorgan, between the celebrated Cistercian monasteries of
Margan and Neth; and the river Neth, descending from the
mountains of Brecheinoc, unites itself with the sea, at no great
distance from the castle of Neth; each of these rivers forming a
long tract of dangerous quicksands.&nbsp; From the same mountains
of Brecheinoc the river Tawe flows down to Abertawe, called in
English Swainsey.&nbsp; The Lochor joins the sea near the castle
of the same name; and the Wendraeth has its confluence near
Cydweli.&nbsp; The Tywy, another noble river, rises in the
Ellennith mountains, and separating the Cantref Mawr from the
Cantref Bachan, passes by the castle of Llanymddyfri, and the
royal palace and castle of Dinevor, strongly situated in the deep
recesses of its woods, by the noble castle of Caermarddin, where
Merlin was found, and from whom the city received its name, and
runs into the sea near the castle of Lhanstephan.&nbsp; The river
Taf rises in the Presseleu mountains, not far from the monastery
of Whitland, and passing by the castle of St. Clare, falls into
the sea near Abercorran and Talacharn.&nbsp; From the same
mountains flow the rivers Cleddeu, encompassing the province of
Daugleddeu, and giving it their name one passes by the castle of
Lahaden, and the other by Haverford, to the sea; and in the
British language they bear the name of Daugleddeu, or two
swords.</p>
<p>The noble river Teivi springs from the Ellennith mountains, in
the upper part of the Cantref Mawr and <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>Caerdigan,
not far from the pastures and excellent monastery of Stratflur,
forming a boundary between Demetia and Caerdigan down to the
Irish channel; this is the only river in Wales that produces
beavers, an account of which is given in our Itinerary; and also
exceeds every other river in the abundance and delicacy of its
salmon.&nbsp; But as this book may fall into the hands of many
persons who will not meet with the other, I have thought it right
here to insert many curious and particular qualities relating to
the nature of these animals, how they convey their materials from
the woods to the river, with what skill they employ these
materials in constructing places of safety in the middle of the
stream, how artfully they defend themselves against the attack of
the hunters on the eastern and how on the western side; the
singularity of their tails, which partake more of the nature of
fish than flesh.&nbsp; For further particulars see the Itinerary.
<a name="citation162a"></a><a href="#footnote162a"
class="citation">[162a]</a></p>
<p>From the same mountains issues the Ystuyth, and flowing
through the upper parts of Penwedic, in Cardiganshire, falls into
the sea near the castle of Aberystuyth.&nbsp; From the snowy
mountains of Eryri flows the noble river Devi, <a
name="citation162b"></a><a href="#footnote162b"
class="citation">[162b]</a> dividing for a great distance North
and South Wales; and from the same mountains also the large river
Maw, <a name="citation162c"></a><a href="#footnote162c"
class="citation">[162c]</a> forming by its course the greater and
<a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>smaller
tract of sands called the Traeth Mawr and the Traeth
Bachan.&nbsp; The Dissennith also, and the Arthro, flow through
Merionethshire and the land of Conan.&nbsp; The Conwy, springing
from the northern side of the Eryri mountains, unites its waters
with the sea under the noble castle of Deganwy.&nbsp; The Cloyd
rises from another side of the same mountain, and passes by the
castle of Ruthlan to the sea.&nbsp; The Doverdwy, called by the
English Dee, draws its source from the lake of Penmelesmere, and
runs through Chester, leaving the wood of Coleshulle, Basinwerk,
and a rich vein of silver in its neighbourhood, far to the right,
and by the influx of the sea forming a very dangerous quicksand;
thus the Dee makes the northern, and the river Wye the southern
boundary of Wales.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CONCERNING THE PLEASANTNESS AND FERTILITY
OF WALES</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the southern part of Wales near
Cardiganshire, but particularly Pembrokeshire, is much
pleasanter, on account of its plains and sea-coast, so North
Wales is better defended by nature, is more productive of men
distinguished for bodily strength, and more fertile in the nature
of its soil; for, as the mountains of Eryri (Snowdon) could
supply pasturage for all the herds of cattle in Wales, if
collected together, so could the Isle of Mona (Anglesey) provide
a requisite quantity of corn for all the inhabitants: on which
account there is an old British proverb, &ldquo;<i>Mon mam
Cymbry</i>,&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;Mona is the mother of
Wales.&rdquo;&nbsp; Merionyth, and the land of <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>Conan, is
the rudest and least cultivated region, and the least
accessible.&nbsp; The natives of that part of Wales excel in the
use of long lances, as those of Monmouthshire are distinguished
for their management of the bow.&nbsp; It is to be observed, that
the British language is more delicate and richer in North Wales,
that country being less intermixed with foreigners.&nbsp; Many,
however, assert that the language of Cardiganshire, in South
Wales, placed as it were in the middle and heart of Cambria, is
the most refined.</p>
<p>The people of Cornwall and the Armoricans speak a language
similar to that of the Britons; and from its origin and near
resemblance, it is intelligible to the Welsh in many instances,
and almost in all; and although less delicate and methodical, yet
it approaches, as I judge, more to the ancient British
idiom.&nbsp; As in the southern parts of England, and
particularly in Devonshire, the English language seems less
agreeable, yet it bears more marks of antiquity (the northern
parts being much corrupted by the irruptions of the Danes and
Norwegians), and adheres more strictly to the original language
and ancient mode of speaking; a positive proof of which may be
deduced from all the English works of Bede, Rhabanus, and king
Alfred, being written according to this idiom.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ORIGIN OF THE NAMES CAMBRIA AND
WALES</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Cambria</span> was so called from Camber,
son of Brutus, for Brutus, descending from the Trojans, by his
grandfather, Ascanius, and father, Silvius, led the remnant of
the Trojans, who had long been detained in Greece, into this
western isle; and having reigned many years, and given his name
to the country and people, at his <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>death divided the kingdom of Wales
between his three sons.&nbsp; To his eldest son, Locrinus, he
gave that part of the island which lies between the rivers Humber
and Severn, and which from him was called Loegria.&nbsp; To his
second son, Albanactus, he gave the lands beyond the Humber,
which took from him the name of Albania.&nbsp; But to his
youngest son, Camber, he bequeathed all that region which lies
beyond the Severn, and is called after him Cambria; hence the
country is properly and truly called Cambria, and its inhabitants
Cambrians, or Cambrenses.&nbsp; Some assert that their name was
derived from <i>Cam</i> and <i>Gr&aelig;co</i>, that is,
distorted Greek, on account of the affinity of their languages,
contracted by their long residence in Greece; but this
conjecture, though plausible, is not well founded on truth.</p>
<p>The name of Wales was not derived from Wallo, a general, or
Wandolena, the queen, as the fabulous history of Geoffrey
Arthurius <a name="citation165a"></a><a href="#footnote165a"
class="citation">[165a]</a> falsely maintains, because neither of
these personages are to be found amongst the Welsh; but it arose
from a barbarian appellation.&nbsp; The Saxons, when they seized
upon Britain, called this nation, as they did all foreigners,
Wallenses; and thus the barbarous name remains to the people and
their country. <a name="citation165b"></a><a href="#footnote165b"
class="citation">[165b]</a></p>
<p>Having discoursed upon the quality and quantity of the land,
the genealogies of the princes, the sources of the rivers, and
the derivation of the names of this country, we shall now
consider the nature and character of the nation.</p>
<h3><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CONCERNING THE NATURE, MANNERS, AND DRESS,
THE BOLDNESS, AGILITY, AND COURAGE, OF THIS NATION</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> people is light and active,
hardy rather than strong, and entirely bred up to the use of
arms; for not only the nobles, but all the people are trained to
war, and when the trumpet sounds the alarm, the husbandman rushes
as eagerly from his plough as the courtier from his court; for
here it is not found that, as in other places,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Agricolis labor
actus in orbem,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>returns; for in the months of March and April only the soil is
once ploughed for oats, and again in the summer a third time, and
in winter for wheat.&nbsp; Almost all the people live upon the
produce of their herds, with oats, milk, cheese, and butter;
eating flesh in larger proportions than bread.&nbsp; They pay no
attention to commerce, shipping, or manufactures, and suffer no
interruption but by martial exercises.&nbsp; They anxiously study
the defence of their country and their liberty; for these they
fight, for these they undergo hardships, and for these willingly
sacrifice their lives; they esteem it a disgrace to die in bed,
an honour to die in the field of battle; using the poet&rsquo;s
expressions,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Procul
hinc avertite pacem,<br />
Nobilitas cum pace perit.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor is it wonderful if it degenerates, for the ancestors of
these men, the &AElig;nead&aelig;, rushed to arms in the cause of
liberty.&nbsp; It is remarkable that this people, though unarmed,
dares attack an armed foe; the infantry defy the cavalry, and by
their activity and courage generally prove victors.&nbsp; They
resemble in disposition and <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>situation those conquerors whom the
poet Lucan mentions:</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash; &mdash;&ldquo;Populi quos despicit
Arctos,<br />
Felices errore suo, quos ille timorum<br />
Maximus haud urget leti metus, inde ruendi<br />
In ferrum, mens prona viris, amim&aelig;que capaces,<br />
Mortis et ignavum reditur&aelig; parsere vit&aelig;.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They make use of light arms, which do not impede their
agility, small coats of mail, bundles of arrows, and long lances,
helmets and shields, and more rarely greaves plated with
iron.&nbsp; The higher class go to battle mounted on swift and
generous steeds, which their country produces; but the greater
part of the people fight on foot, on account of the marshy nature
and unevenness of the soil.&nbsp; The horsemen as their situation
or occasion requires, willingly serve as infantry, in attacking
or retreating; and they either walk bare-footed, or make use of
high shoes, roughly constructed with untanned leather.&nbsp; In
time of peace, the young men, by penetrating the deep recesses of
the woods, and climbing the tops of mountains, learn by practice
to endure fatigue through day and night; and as they meditate on
war during peace, they acquire the art of fighting by accustoming
themselves to the use of the lance, and by inuring themselves to
hard exercise.</p>
<p>In our time, king Henry II., in reply to the inquiries of
Emanuel, emperor of Constantinople, concerning the situation,
nature, and striking peculiarities of the British island, among
other remarkable circumstances mentioned the following:
&ldquo;That in a certain part of the island there was a people,
called Welsh, so bold and ferocious that, when unarmed, they did
not fear to encounter an armed force; being ready to shed their
blood in defence of their country, and to sacrifice their lives
for renown; which is the more surprising, as the beasts of the
field over the whole face of the island became gentle, but these
desperate men could not be tamed.&nbsp; The wild animals, and
particularly the stags and hinds, <a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>are so abundant, owing to the little
molestation they receive, that in our time, in the northern parts
of the island towards the Peak, <a name="citation168"></a><a
href="#footnote168" class="citation">[168]</a> when pursued by
the hounds and hunters, they contributed, by their numbers, to
their own destruction.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THEIR SOBER SUPPER AND
FRUGALITY</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> addicted to gluttony or
drunkenness, this people who incur no expense in food or dress,
and whose minds are always bent upon the defence of their
country, and on the means of plunder, are wholly employed in the
care of their horses and furniture.&nbsp; Accustomed to fast from
morning till evening, and trusting to the care of Providence,
they dedicate the whole day to business, and in the evening
partake of a moderate meal; and even if they have none, or only a
very scanty one, they patiently wait till the next evening; and,
neither deterred by cold nor hunger, they employ the dark and
stormy nights in watching the hostile motions of their
enemies.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THEIR HOSPITALITY AND
LIBERALITY</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">No</span> one of this nation ever begs,
for the houses of all are common to all; and they consider
liberality and hospitality amongst the first virtues.&nbsp; So
much does hospitality here rejoice in communication, that it is
neither offered nor requested by travellers, who, on entering any
house, only deliver up their arms.&nbsp; When <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>water is
offered to them, if they suffer their feet to be washed, they are
received as guests; for the offer of water to wash the feet is
with this nation an hospitable invitation.&nbsp; But if they
refuse the proffered service, they only wish for morning
refreshment, not lodging.&nbsp; The young men move about in
troops and families under the direction of a chosen leader.&nbsp;
Attached only to arms and ease, and ever ready to stand forth in
defence of their country, they have free admittance into every
house as if it were their own.</p>
<p>Those who arrive in the morning are entertained till evening
with the conversation of young women, and the music of the harp;
for each house has its young women and harps allotted to this
purpose.&nbsp; Two circumstances here deserve notice: that as no
nation labours more under the vice of jealousy than the Irish, so
none is more free from it than the Welsh: and in each family the
art of playing on the harp is held preferable to any other
learning.&nbsp; In the evening, when no more guests are expected,
the meal is prepared according to the number and dignity of the
persons assembled, and according to the wealth of the family who
entertains.&nbsp; The kitchen does not supply many dishes, nor
high-seasoned incitements to eating.&nbsp; The house is not
furnished with tables, cloths, or napkins.&nbsp; They study
nature more than splendour, for which reason, the guests being
seated in threes, instead of couples as elsewhere, <a
name="citation169a"></a><a href="#footnote169a"
class="citation">[169a]</a> they place the dishes before them all
at once upon rushes and fresh grass, in large platters or
trenchers.&nbsp; They also make use of a thin and broad cake of
bread, baked every day, such as in old writings was called
<i>lagana</i>; <a name="citation169b"></a><a href="#footnote169b"
class="citation">[169b]</a> and they <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>sometimes add chopped meat, with
broth.&nbsp; Such a repast was formerly used by the noble youth,
from whom this nation boasts its descent, and whose manners it
still partly imitates, according to the word of the poet:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Heu! mensas
consumimus, inquit Iulus.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the family is engaged in waiting on the guests, the host
and hostess stand up, paying unremitting attention to everything,
and take no food till all the company are satisfied; that in case
of any deficiency, it may fall upon them.&nbsp; A bed made of
rushes, and covered with a coarse kind of cloth manufactured in
the country, called <i>brychan</i>, <a name="citation170"></a><a
href="#footnote170" class="citation">[170]</a> is then placed
along the side of the room, and they all in common lie down to
sleep; nor is their dress at night different from that by day,
for at all seasons they defend themselves from the cold only by a
thin cloak and tunic.&nbsp; The fire continues to burn by night
as well as by day, at their feet, and they receive much comfort
from the natural heat of the persons lying near them; but when
the under side begins to be tired with the hardness of the bed,
or the upper one to suffer from cold, they immediately leap up,
and go to the fire, which soon relieves them from both
inconveniences; and then returning to their couch, they expose
alternately their sides to the cold, and to the hardness of the
bed.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CONCERNING THEIR CUTTING OF THEIR HAIR,
THEIR CARE OF THEIR TEETH, AND SHAVING OF THEIR BEARD</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> men and women cut their hair
close round to the ears and eyes.&nbsp; The women, after the
manner of the <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>Parthians, cover their heads with a large white veil,
folded together in the form of a crown.</p>
<p>Both sexes exceed any other nation in attention to their
teeth, which they render like ivory, by constantly rubbing them
with green hazel and wiping with a woollen cloth.&nbsp; For their
better preservation, they abstain from hot meats, and eat only
such as are cold, warm, or temperate.&nbsp; The men shave all
their beard except the moustaches (<i>gernoboda</i>).&nbsp; This
custom is not recent, but was observed in ancient and remote
ages, as we find in the works of Julius C&aelig;sar, who says, <a
name="citation171"></a><a href="#footnote171"
class="citation">[171]</a> &ldquo;The Britons shave every part of
their body except their head and upper lip;&rdquo; and to render
themselves more active, and avoid the fate of Absalon in their
excursions through the woods, they are accustomed to cut even the
hair from their heads; so that this nation more than any other
shaves off all pilosity.&nbsp; Julius also adds, that the
Britons, previous to an engagement, anointed their faces with a
nitrous ointment, which gave them so ghastly and shining an
appearance, that the enemy could scarcely bear to look at them,
particularly if the rays of the sun were reflected on them.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">OF THEIR QUICKNESS AND SHARPNESS OF
UNDERSTANDING</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">These</span> people being of a sharp and
acute intellect, and gifted with a rich and powerful
understanding, excel in whatever studies they pursue, and are
more quick and cunning than the other inhabitants of a western
clime.</p>
<p>Their musical instruments charm and delight the ear <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>with their
sweetness, are borne along by such celerity and delicacy of
modulation, producing such a consonance from the rapidity of
seemingly discordant touches, that I shall briefly repeat what is
set forth in our Irish Topography on the subject of the musical
instruments of the three nations.&nbsp; It is astonishing that in
so complex and rapid a movement of the fingers, the musical
proportions can be preserved, and that throughout the difficult
modulations on their various instruments, the harmony is
completed with such a sweet velocity, so unequal an equality, so
discordant a concord, as if the chords sounded together fourths
or fifths.&nbsp; They always begin from B flat, and return to the
same, that the whole may be completed under the sweetness of a
pleasing sound.&nbsp; They enter into a movement, and conclude it
in so delicate a manner, and play the little notes so sportively
under the blunter sounds of the base strings, enlivening with
wanton levity, or communicating a deeper internal sensation of
pleasure, so that the perfection of their art appears in the
concealment of it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Si lateat, prosit;<br />
&mdash; &mdash; ferat ars deprensa pudorem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Art profits when concealed,<br />
Disgraces when revealed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this cause, those very strains which afford deep and
unspeakable mental delight to those who have skilfully penetrated
into the mysteries of the art, fatigue rather than gratify the
ears of others, who seeing, do not perceive, and hearing, do not
understand; and by whom the finest music is esteemed no better
than a confused and disorderly noise, and will be heard with
unwillingness and disgust.</p>
<p>They make use of three instruments, the harp, the pipe, and
the crwth or crowd (<i>chorus</i>). <a name="citation172"></a><a
href="#footnote172" class="citation">[172]</a></p>
<p><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>They
omit no part of natural rhetoric in the management of civil
actions, in quickness of invention, disposition, refutation, and
confirmation.&nbsp; In their rhymed songs and set speeches they
are so subtle and ingenious, that they produce, in their native
tongue, ornaments of wonderful and exquisite invention both in
the words and sentences.&nbsp; Hence arise those poets whom they
call Bards, of whom you will find many in this nation, endowed
with the above faculty, according to the poet&rsquo;s
observation:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Plurima concreti fuderunt carmina
Bardi.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But they make use of alliteration (<i>anominatione</i>) in
preference to all other ornaments of rhetoric, and that
particular kind which joins by consonancy the first letters or
syllables of words.&nbsp; So much do the English and Welsh
nations employ this ornament of words in all exquisite
composition, that no sentence is esteemed to be elegantly spoken,
no oration to be otherwise than uncouth and unrefined, unless it
be fully polished with the file of this figure.&nbsp; Thus in the
British tongue:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Digawn Duw da i unic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrth bob crybwyll rha&iuml;d pwyll parawd.&rdquo; <a
name="citation173"></a><a href="#footnote173"
class="citation">[173]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>And
in English,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;God is together gammen and
wisedom.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same ornament of speech is also frequent in the Latin
language.&nbsp; Virgil says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tales casus Cassandra canebat.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again, in his address to Augustus,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dum dubitet natura marem, faceretve
puellam,<br />
Natus es, o pulcher, pene puella, puer.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This ornament occurs not in any language we know so frequently
as in the two first; it is, indeed, surprising that the French,
in other respects so ornamented, should be entirely ignorant of
this verbal elegance so much adopted in other languages.&nbsp;
Nor can I believe that the English and Welsh, so different and
adverse to each other, could designedly have agreed in the usage
of this figure; but I should rather suppose that it had grown
habitual to both by long custom, as it pleases the ear by a
transition from similar to similar sounds.&nbsp; Cicero, in his
book &ldquo;On Elocution,&rdquo; observes of such who know the
practice, not the art, &ldquo;Other persons when they read good
orations or poems, approve of the orators or poets, not
understanding the reason why, being affected, they approve;
because they cannot know in what place, of what nature, nor how
that effect is caused which so highly delights them.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THEIR SYMPHONIES AND SONGS</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> their musical concerts they do
not sing in unison like the inhabitants of other countries, but
in many different <a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>parts; so that in a company of singers, which one very
frequently meets with in Wales, you will hear as many different
parts and voices as there are performers, who all at length
unite, with organic melody, in one consonance and the soft
sweetness of B flat.&nbsp; In the northern district of Britain,
beyond the Humber, and on the borders of Yorkshire, the
inhabitants make use of the same kind of symphonious harmony, but
with less variety; singing only in two parts, one murmuring in
the base, the other warbling in the acute or treble.&nbsp;
Neither of the two nations has acquired this peculiarity by art,
but by long habit, which has rendered it natural and familiar;
and the practice is now so firmly rooted in them, that it is
unusual to hear a simple and single melody well sung; and, what
is still more wonderful, the children, even from their infancy,
sing in the same manner.&nbsp; As the English in general do not
adopt this mode of singing, but only those of the northern
countries, I believe that it was from the Danes and Norwegians,
by whom these parts of the island were more frequently invaded,
and held longer under their dominion, that the natives contracted
their mode of singing as well as speaking.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THEIR WIT AND PLEASANTRY</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> heads of different families, in
order to excite the laughter of their guests, and gain credit by
their sayings, make use of great facetiousness in their
conversation; at one time uttering their jokes in a light, easy
manner, at another time, under the disguise of equivocation,
passing the severest censures.&nbsp; For the sake of explanation
I shall here subjoin a few examples.&nbsp; Tegeingl is the name
of a province in North Wales, over which David, son of <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>Owen, had
dominion, and which had once been in the possession of his
brother.&nbsp; The same word also was the name of a certain woman
with whom, it was said, each brother had an intrigue, from which
circumstance arose this term of reproach, &ldquo;To have
Tegeingl, after Tegeingl had been in possession of his
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At another time, when Rhys, son of Gruffydd, prince of South
Wales, accompanied by a multitude of his people, devoutly entered
the church of St. David&rsquo;s, previous to an intended journey,
the oblations having been made, and mass solemnised, a young man
came to him in the church, and publicly declared himself to be
his son, threw himself at his feet, and with tears humbly
requested that the truth of this assertion might be ascertained
by the trial of the burning iron.&nbsp; Intelligence of this
circumstance being conveyed to his family and his two sons, who
had just gone out of the church, a youth who was present made
this remark: &ldquo;This is not wonderful; some have brought
gold, and others silver, as offerings; but this man, who had
neither, brought what he had, namely, iron;&rdquo; thus taunting
him with his poverty.&nbsp; On mentioning a certain house that
was strongly built and almost impregnable, one of the company
said, &ldquo;This house indeed is strong, for if it should
contain food it could never be got at,&rdquo; thus alluding both
to the food and to the house.&nbsp; In like manner, a person,
wishing to hint at the avaricious disposition of the mistress of
a house, said, &ldquo;I only find fault with our hostess for
putting too little butter to her salt,&rdquo; whereas the
accessory should be put to the principal; thus, by a subtle
transposition of the words, converting the accessory into the
principal, by making it appear to abound in quantity.&nbsp; Many
similar sayings of great men and philosophers are recorded in the
Saturnalia of Macrobius.&nbsp; When Cicero saw his son-in-law,
Lentulus, a man of small stature, with a long sword by his side:
&ldquo;Who,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;has girded my son-in-law to
that sword?&rdquo; thus changing the accessary into the
principal.&nbsp; The same person, on seeing <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>the
half-length portrait of his brother Quintus Cicero, drawn with
very large features and an immense shield, exclaimed, &ldquo;Half
of my brother is greater than the whole!&rdquo;&nbsp; When the
sister of Faustus had an intrigue with a fuller, &ldquo;Is it
strange,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that my sister has a spot, when
she is connected with a fuller?&rdquo;&nbsp; When Antiochus
showed Hannibal his army, and the great warlike preparations he
had made against the Romans, and asked him, &ldquo;Thinkest thou,
O Hannibal, that these are sufficient for the
Romans?&rdquo;&nbsp; Hannibal, ridiculing the unmilitary
appearance of the soldiers, wittily and severely replied,
&ldquo;I certainly think them sufficient for the Romans, however
greedy;&rdquo; Antiochus asking his opinion about the military
preparations, and Hannibal alluding to them as becoming a prey to
the Romans.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THEIR BOLDNESS AND CONFIDENCE IN
SPEAKING</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Nature</span> hath given not only to the
highest, but also to the inferior, classes of the people of this
nation, a boldness and confidence in speaking and answering, even
in the presence of their princes and chieftains.&nbsp; The Romans
and Franks had the same faculty; but neither the English, nor the
Saxons and Germans, from whom they are descended, had it.&nbsp;
It is in vain urged, that this defect may arise from the state of
servitude which the English endured; for the Saxons and Germans,
who enjoy their liberty, have the same failing, and derive this
natural coldness of disposition from the frozen region they
inhabit; the English also, although placed in a distant climate,
still retain the exterior fairness of complexion and inward
coldness of disposition, as inseparable from their original and
natural character.&nbsp; The Britons, on <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>the
contrary, transplanted from the hot and parched regions of
Dardania into these more temperate districts, as</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;C&oelig;lum non
animum mutant qui trans mare currunt,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>still retain their brown complexion and that natural warmth of
temper from which their confidence is derived.&nbsp; For three
nations, remnants of the Greeks after the destruction of Troy,
fled from Asia into different parts of Europe, the Romans under
&AElig;neas, the Franks under Antenor, and the Britons under
Brutus; and from thence arose that courage, that nobleness of
mind, that ancient dignity, that acuteness of understanding, and
confidence of speech, for which these three nations are so highly
distinguished.&nbsp; But the Britons, from having been detained
longer in Greece than the other two nations, after the
destruction of their country, and having migrated at a later
period into the western parts of Europe, retained in a greater
degree the primitive words and phrases of their native
language.&nbsp; You will find amongst them the names Oenus,
Resus, &AElig;neas, Hector, Achilles, Heliodorus, Theodorus,
Ajax, Evander, Uliex, Anianus, Elisa, Guendolena, and many
others, bearing marks of their antiquity.&nbsp; It is also to be
observed, that almost all words in the British language
correspond either with the Greek or Latin, as
&#8017;&delta;&omega;&zeta;, water, is called in British, dwr;
&#7937;&lambda;&sigmaf;, salt, in British, halen;
&omicron;&nu;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;, eno, a name;
&pi;&epsilon;&nu;&tau;&epsilon;, pump, five;
&delta;&epsilon;&kappa;&alpha;, deg, ten.&nbsp; The Latins also
use the words fr&aelig;num, tripos, gladius, lorica; the Britons,
froyn (ffrwyn), trepet (tribedd), cleddyf, and lluric (llurig);
unicus is made unic (unig); canis, can (cwn); and belua,
beleu.</p>

179</span>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CONCERNING THE SOOTHSAYERS OF THIS NATION,
AND PERSONS AS IT WERE POSSESSED</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are certain persons in
Cambria, whom you will find nowhere else, called Awenddyon, <a
name="citation179"></a><a href="#footnote179"
class="citation">[179]</a> or people inspired; when consulted
upon any doubtful event, they roar out violently, are rendered
beside themselves, and become, as it were, possessed by a
spirit.&nbsp; They do not deliver the answer to what is required
in a connected manner; but the person who skilfully observes
them, will find, after many preambles, and many nugatory and
incoherent, though ornamented speeches, the desired explanation
conveyed in some turn of a word: they are then roused from their
ecstasy, as from a deep sleep, and, as it were, by violence
compelled to return to their proper senses.&nbsp; After having
answered the questions, they do not recover till violently shaken
by other people; nor can they remember the replies they have
given.&nbsp; If consulted a second or third time upon the same
point, they will make use of expressions totally different;
perhaps they speak by the means of fanatic and ignorant
spirits.&nbsp; These gifts are usually conferred upon them in
dreams: some seem to have sweet milk or honey poured on their
lips; others fancy that a written schedule is applied to their
mouths and on awaking they publicly declare that they have
received this gift.&nbsp; Such is the saying of Esdras,
&ldquo;The Lord said unto me, open thy mouth, and I opened my
mouth, and behold a cup full of water, whose colour was like
fire; and when I had drank it, my heart brought forth
understanding, and wisdom entered <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>into my breast.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
invoke, during their prophecies, the true and living God, and the
Holy Trinity, and pray that they may not by their sins be
prevented from finding the truth.&nbsp; These prophets are only
found among the Britons descended from the Trojans.&nbsp; For
Calchas and Cassandra, endowed with the spirit of prophecy,
openly foretold, during the siege of Troy, the destruction of
that fine city; on which account the high priest, Helenus,
influenced by the prophetic books of Calchas, and of others who
had long before predicted the ruin of their country, in the first
year went over to the Greeks with the sons of Priam (to whom he
was high priest), and was afterwards rewarded in Greece.&nbsp;
Cassandra, daughter of king Priam, every day foretold the
overthrow of the city; but the pride and presumption of the
Trojans prevented them from believing her word.&nbsp; Even on the
very night that the city was betrayed, she clearly described the
treachery and the method of it:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;&mdash; tales
casus Cassandra canebat,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as in the same manner, during the existence of the kingdom of
the Britons, both Merlin Caledonius and Ambrosius are said to
have foretold the destruction of their nation, as well as the
coming of the Saxons, and afterwards that of the Normans; and I
think a circumstance related by Aulus Gellius worth inserting in
this place.&nbsp; On the day that Caius C&aelig;sar and Cneius
Pompey, during the civil war, fought a pitched battle in
Thessalia, a memorable event occurred in that part of Italy
situated beyond the river Po.&nbsp; A priest named Cornelius,
honourable from his rank, venerable for his religion, and holy in
his manners, in an inspired moment proclaimed, &ldquo;C&aelig;sar
has conquered,&rdquo; and named the day, the events, the mutual
attack, and the conflicts of the two armies.&nbsp; Whether such
things are exhibited by the spirit, let the reader more
particularly inquire; I do not assert they are the acts of a
Pythonic or a diabolic spirit; for as foreknowledge is the
property of God alone, so is it in his <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>power to
confer knowledge of future events.&nbsp; There are differences of
gifts, says the Apostle, but one and the same spirit; whence
Peter, in his second Epistle, writes, &ldquo;For the prophecy
came not in the old time by the will of man, but men spake as if
they were inspired by the Holy Ghost:&rdquo; to the same effect
did the Chaldeans answer king Nebuchadonazar on the
interpretation of his dream, which he wished to extort from
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is not,&rdquo; say they, &ldquo;a man
upon earth who can, O king, satisfactorily answer your question;
let no king therefore, however great or potent, make a similar
request to any magician, astrologer, or Chaldean; for it is a
rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that
can shew it before the king, except the Gods, whose dwelling is
not with flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this passage Jerome remarks,
&ldquo;The diviners and all the learned of this world confess,
that the prescience of future events belongs to God alone; the
prophets therefore, who foretold things to come, spake by the
spirit of God.&nbsp; Hence some persons object, that, if they
were under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, they would sometimes
premise, &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord God,&rdquo; or make use of
some expression in the prophetic style; and as such a mode of
prophesying is not taken notice of by Merlin, and no mention is
made of his sanctity, devotion, or faith, many think that he
spake by a Pythonic spirit.&nbsp; To which I answer, that the
spirit of prophecy was given not only to the holy, but sometimes
to unbelievers and Gentiles, to Baal, to the sibyls, and even to
bad people, as to Caiaphas and Bela.&nbsp; On which occasion
Origen says: &ldquo;Do not wonder, if he whom ye have mentioned
declares that the Scribes and Pharisees and doctors amongst the
Jews prophesied concerning Christ; for Caiaphas said: &ldquo;It
is expedient for us that one man die for the people:&rdquo; but
asserts at the same time, that because he was high priest for
that year, he prophesied.&nbsp; Let no man therefore be lifted
up, if he prophesies, if he merits prescience; for prophecies
shall fail, tongues shall cease, knowledge shall vanish <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>away; and
now abideth, faith, hope, and charity: these three; but the
greatest of these is Charity, which never faileth.&nbsp; But
these bad men not only prophesied, but sometimes performed great
miracles, which others could not accomplish.&nbsp; John the
Baptist, who was so great a personage, performed no miracle, as
John the Evangelist testifies: &ldquo;And many came to Jesus and
said, Because John wrought no signs,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; Nor do we
hear that the mother of God performed any miracle; we read in the
Acts of the Apostles, that the sons of Sheva cast out devils in
the name of Jesus, whom Paul preached; and in Matthew and Luke we
may find these words: &ldquo;Many shall say unto me in that day,
Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name
have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
and then I will profess unto them, I never knew you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And in another place, John says: &ldquo;Master, we saw a certain
man casting out devils in thy name, and forbade him, because he
followeth not with us.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Jesus said: &ldquo;Forbid
him not; no man can do a miracle in my name, and speak evil of
me; for whoever is not against me, is for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alexander of Macedon, a gentile, traversed the Caspian
mountains, and miraculously confined ten tribes within their
promontories, where they still remain, and will continue until
the coming of Elias and Enoch.&nbsp; We read, indeed, the
prophecies of Merlin, but hear nothing either of his sanctity or
his miracles.&nbsp; Some say, that the prophets, when they
prophesied, did not become frantic, as it is affirmed of Merlin
Silvestris, and others possessed, whom we have before
mentioned.&nbsp; Some prophesied by dreams, visions, and
enigmatical sayings, as Ezechiel and Daniel; others by acts and
words, as Noah, in the construction of the ark, alluded to the
church; Abraham, in the slaying of his son, to the passion of
Christ; and Moses by his speech, when he said, &ldquo;A prophet
shall the Lord God raise up to you of your brethren; hear
him;&rdquo; meaning Christ.&nbsp; Others have prophesied in a
more excellent <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>way by the internal revelation and inspiration of the
Holy Spirit, as David did when persecuted by Saul: &ldquo;When
Saul heard that David had fled to Naioth (which is a hill in
Ramah, and the seat of the prophets), he sent messengers to take
him; and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying,
and Samuel standing at their head, the Spirit of God came upon
the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied; and he sent
messengers a second and again a third time, and they also
prophesied.&nbsp; And Saul enraged went thither also; and the
Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied
until he came to Naioth, and he stripped off his royal vestments,
and prophesied with the rest for all that day and all that night;
whilst David and Samuel secretly observed what
passed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor is it wonderful that those persons who
suddenly receive the Spirit of God, and so signal a mark of
grace, should for a time seem alienated from their earthly state
of mind.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THEIR LOVE OF HIGH BIRTH AND ANCIENT
GENEALOGY</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Welsh esteem noble birth and
generous descent above all things, <a name="citation183"></a><a
href="#footnote183" class="citation">[183]</a> and are,
therefore, more desirous of marrying into noble than rich
families.&nbsp; Even the <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>common people retain their
genealogy, and can not only readily recount the names of their
grandfathers and great-grandfathers, but even refer back to the
sixth or seventh generation, or beyond them, in this manner:
Rhys, son of Gruffydd, son of Rhys, son of Tewdwr, son of Eineon,
son of Owen, son of Howel, son of Cadell, son of Roderic Mawr,
and so on.</p>
<p>Being particularly attached to family descent, they revenge
with vehemence the injuries which may tend to the disgrace of
their blood; and being naturally of a vindictive and passionate
disposition, they are ever ready to avenge not only recent but
ancient affronts; they neither inhabit towns, villages, nor
castles, but lead a solitary life in the woods, on the borders of
which they do not erect sumptuous palaces, nor lofty stone
buildings, but content themselves with small huts made of the
boughs of trees twisted together, constructed with little labour
and expense, and sufficient to endure throughout the year.&nbsp;
They have neither orchards nor gardens, but gladly eat the fruit
of both when given to them.&nbsp; The greater part of their land
is laid down to pasturage; little is cultivated, a very small
quantity is ornamented with flowers, and a still smaller is
sown.&nbsp; They seldom yoke less than four oxen to their
ploughs; the driver walks before, but backwards, and when he
falls down, is frequently exposed to danger from the refractory
oxen.&nbsp; Instead of small sickles in mowing, they make use of
a moderate-sized piece of iron formed like a knife, with two
pieces of wood fixed loosely and flexibly to the head, which they
think a more expeditious instrument; but since</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Segnius irritant animos demissa per
aures,<br />
Quam qu&aelig; sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>their mode of using it will be better known by inspection than
by any description.&nbsp; The boats <a name="citation184"></a><a
href="#footnote184" class="citation">[184]</a> which they employ
<a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>in
fishing or in crossing the rivers are made of twigs, not oblong
nor pointed, but almost round, or rather triangular, covered both
within and without with raw hides.&nbsp; When a salmon thrown
into one of these boats strikes it hard with his tail, he often
oversets it, and endangers both the vessel and its
navigator.&nbsp; The fishermen, according to the custom of the
country, in going to and from the rivers, carry these boats on
their shoulders; on which occasion that famous dealer in fables,
Bleddercus, who lived a little before our time, thus mysteriously
said: &ldquo;There is amongst us a people who, when they go out
in search of prey, carry their horses on their backs to the place
of plunder; in order to catch their prey, they leap upon their
horses, and when it is taken, carry their horses home again upon
their shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THE ANTIQUITY OF THEIR FAITH, THEIR
LOVE OF CHRISTIANITY AND DEVOTION</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> ancient times, and about two
hundred years before the overthrow of Britain, the Welsh were
instructed and confirmed in the faith by Faganus and Damianus,
sent into the island at the request of king Lucius by pope
Eleutherius, and from that period when Germanus of Auxerre, and
Lupus of Troyes, came over on account of the corruption which had
crept into the island by the invasion of the Saxons, but
particularly with a view of expelling the Pelagian heresy,
nothing heretical or contrary to the true faith was to be found
amongst the natives.&nbsp; But it is said that some parts of the
ardent doctrines are still retained.&nbsp; They give the first
piece broken off from every loaf of bread to the poor; they sit
down to dinner by three to a dish, in honour of the
Trinity.&nbsp; With extended arms and bowing head, they ask a
blessing of every monk or priest, or of every person <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>wearing a
religious habit.&nbsp; But they desire, above all other nations,
the episcopal ordination and unction, by which the grace of the
spirit is given.&nbsp; They give a tenth of all their property,
animals, cattle, and sheep, either when they marry, or go on a
pilgrimage, or, by the counsel of the church, are persuaded to
amend their lives.&nbsp; This partition of their effects they
call the great tithe, two parts of which they give to the church
where they were baptised, and the third to the bishop of the
diocese.&nbsp; But of all pilgrimages they prefer that to Rome,
where they pay the most fervent adoration to the apostolic
see.&nbsp; We observe that they show a greater respect than other
nations to churches and ecclesiastical persons, to the relics of
saints, bells, holy books, and the cross, which they devoutly
revere; and hence their churches enjoy more than common
tranquillity.&nbsp; For peace is not only preserved towards all
animals feeding in churchyards, but at a great distance beyond
them, where certain boundaries and ditches have been appointed by
the bishops, in order to maintain the security of the
sanctuary.&nbsp; But the principal churches to which antiquity
has annexed the greater reverence extend their protection to the
herds as far as they can go to feed in the morning and return at
night.&nbsp; If, therefore, any person has incurred the enmity of
his prince, on applying to the church for protection, he and his
family will continue to live unmolested; but many persons abuse
this indemnity, far exceeding the indulgence of the canon, which
in such cases grants only personal safety; and from the places of
refuge even make hostile irruptions, and more severely harass the
country than the prince himself.&nbsp; Hermits and anchorites
more strictly abstinent and more spiritual can nowhere be found;
for this nation is earnest in all its pursuits, and neither worse
men than the bad, nor better than the good, can be met with.</p>
<p>Happy and fortunate indeed would this nation be, nay,
completely blessed, if it had good prelates and pastors, and but
one prince, and that prince a good one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> in the former book clearly
set forth the character, manners, and customs of the British
nation, and having collected and explained everything which could
redound to its credit or glory; an attention to order now
requires that, in this second part, we should employ our pen in
pointing out those particulars in which it seems to transgress
the line of virtue and commendation; having first obtained leave
to speak the truth, without which history not only loses its
authority, but becomes undeserving of its very name.&nbsp; For
the painter who professes to imitate nature, loses his
reputation, if, by indulging his fancy, he represents only those
parts of the subject which best suit him.</p>
<p>Since, therefore, no man is born without faults, and he is
esteemed the best whose errors are the least, let the wise man
consider everything human as connected with himself; for in
worldly affairs there is no perfect happiness under heaven.&nbsp;
Evil borders upon good, and vices are confounded with virtues; as
the report of good qualities is delightful to a well-disposed
mind, so the relation of the contrary should not be
offensive.&nbsp; The natural disposition of this nation might
have been corrupted and perverted by long exile and poverty; for
as poverty extinguisheth many faults, so it often generates
failings that are contrary to virtue.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">OF THE INCONSTANCY AND INSTABILITY OF THIS
NATION, AND THEIR WANT OF REVERENCE FOR GOOD FAITH AND
OATHS</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">These</span> people are no less light in
mind than in body, and are by no means to be relied upon.&nbsp;
They are easily urged to undertake any action, and are as easily
checked from prosecuting it&mdash;a people quick in action, but
more stubborn in a bad than in a good cause, and constant only in
acts of inconstancy.&nbsp; They pay no respect to oaths, faith,
or truth; and so lightly do they esteem the covenant of faith,
held so inviolable by other nations, that it is usual to
sacrifice their faith for nothing, by holding forth the right
hand, not only in serious and important concerns, but even on
every trifling occasion, and for the confirmation of almost every
common assertion.&nbsp; They never scruple at taking a false oath
for the sake of any temporary emolument or advantage; so that in
civil and ecclesiastical causes, each party, being ready to swear
whatever seems expedient to its purpose, endeavours both to prove
and defend, although the venerable laws, by which oaths are
deemed sacred, and truth is honoured and respected, by favouring
the accused and throwing an odium upon the accuser, impose the
burden of bringing proofs upon the latter.&nbsp; But to a people
so cunning and crafty, this yoke is pleasant, and this burden is
light.</p>
<h3><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THEIR LIVING BY PLUNDER, AND DISREGARD OF
THE BONDS OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> nation conceives it right to
commit acts of plunder, theft, and robbery, not only against
foreigners and hostile nations, but even against their own
countrymen.&nbsp; When an opportunity of attacking the enemy with
advantage occurs, they respect not the leagues of peace and
friendship, preferring base lucre to the solemn obligations of
oaths and good faith; to which circumstance Gildas alludes in his
book concerning the overthrow of the Britons, actuated by the
love of truth, and according to the rules of history, not
suppressing the vices of his countrymen.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are
neither brave in war, nor faithful in peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
when Julius C&aelig;sar, great as the world itself,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Territa
qu&aelig;sitis ostendit terga Britannis,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>were they not brave under their leader Cassivellaunus?&nbsp;
And when Belinus and Brennus added the Roman empire to their
conquests?&nbsp; What were they in the time of Constantine, son
of our Helen?&nbsp; What, in the reign of Aurelius Ambrosius,
whom even Eutropius commends?&nbsp; What were they in the time of
our famous prince Arthur?&nbsp; I will not say fabulous.&nbsp; On
the contrary, they, who were almost subdued by the Scots and
Picts, often harassed with success the auxiliary Roman legions,
and exclaimed, as we learn from Gildas, &ldquo;The barbarians
drove us to the sea, the sea drove us again back to the
barbarians; on one side we were subdued, on the other drowned,
and here we were put to death.&nbsp; Were they not,&rdquo; says
he, &ldquo;at that time brave and praiseworthy?&rdquo;&nbsp; When
attacked and conquered by the Saxons, who originally had been
called in as stipendiaries <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>to their assistance, were they not
brave?&nbsp; But the strongest argument made use of by those who
accuse this nation of cowardice, is, that Gildas, a holy man, and
a Briton by birth, has handed down to posterity nothing
remarkable concerning them, in any of his historical works.&nbsp;
We promise, however, a solution of the contrary in our British
Topography, if God grants us a continuance of life.</p>
<p>As a further proof, it may be necessary to add, that from the
time when that illustrious prince of the Britons, mentioned at
the beginning of this book, totally exhausted the strength of the
country, by transporting the whole armed force beyond the seas;
that island, which had before been so highly illustrious for its
incomparable valour, remained for many subsequent years destitute
of men and arms, and exposed to the predatory attacks of pirates
and robbers.&nbsp; So distinguished, indeed, were the natives of
this island for their bravery, that, by their prowess, that king
subdued almost all Cisalpine Gaul, and dared even to make an
attack on the Roman empire.</p>
<p>In process of time, the Britons, recovering their long-lost
population and knowledge of the use of arms, re-acquired their
high and ancient character.&nbsp; Let the different &aelig;ras be
therefore marked, and the historical accounts will accord.&nbsp;
With regard to Gildas, who inveighs so bitterly against his own
nation, the Britons affirm that, highly irritated at the death of
his brother, the prince of Albania, whom king Arthur had slain,
he wrote these invectives, and upon the same occasion threw into
the sea many excellent books, in which he had described the
actions of Arthur, and the celebrated deeds of his countrymen;
from which cause it arises, that no authentic account of so great
a prince is any where to be found.</p>
<h3><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THEIR DEFICIENCY IN BATTLE, AND BASE
AND DISHONOURABLE FLIGHT</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> war this nation is very severe
in the first attack, terrible by their clamour and looks, filling
the air with horrid shouts and the deep-toned clangour of very
long trumpets; swift and rapid in their advances and frequent
throwing of darts.&nbsp; Bold in the first onset, they cannot
bear a repulse, being easily thrown into confusion as soon as
they turn their backs; and they trust to flight for safety,
without attempting to rally, which the poet thought reprehensible
in martial conflicts:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Ignavum scelus
est tantum fuga;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and elsewhere&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;In vitium
culp&aelig; ducit fuga, si caret arte.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The character given to the Teutones in the Roman History, may
be applied to this people.&nbsp; &ldquo;In their first attack
they are more than men, in the second, less than
women.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their courage manifests itself chiefly in the
retreat, when they frequently return, and, like the Parthians,
shoot their arrows behind them; and, as after success and victory
in battle, even cowards boast of their courage, so, after a
reverse of fortune, even the bravest men are not allowed their
due claims of merit.&nbsp; Their mode of fighting consists in
chasing the enemy or in retreating.&nbsp; This light-armed
people, relying more on their activity than on their strength,
cannot struggle for the field of battle, enter into close
engagement, or endure long and severe actions, such as the poet
describes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Jam clypeo clypeus, umbone repellitur
umbo,<br />
Ense minax ensis, pede pes, et cuspide cuspis.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though defeated and put to flight on one day, they are <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>ready to
resume the combat on the next, neither dejected by their loss,
nor by their dishonour; and although, perhaps, they do not
display great fortitude in open engagements and regular
conflicts, yet they harass the enemy by ambuscades and nightly
sallies.&nbsp; Hence, neither oppressed by hunger or cold, nor
fatigued by martial labours, nor despondent in adversity, but
ready, after a defeat, to return immediately to action, and again
endure the dangers of war; they are as easy to overcome in a
single battle, as difficult to subdue in a protracted war.&nbsp;
The poet Claudian thus speaks of a people similar in
disposition:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dum percunt, memin&ecirc;re mali: si corda
parumper<br />
Respirare sinas, nullo tot funera censu<br />
Pr&aelig;tercunt, tantique levis jactura cruoris.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THEIR AMBITIOUS SEIZURE OF LANDS, AND
DISSENSIONS AMONG BROTHERS</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> nation is, above all others,
addicted to the digging up of boundary ditches, removing the
limits, transgressing landmarks, and extending their territory by
every possible means.&nbsp; So great is their disposition towards
this common violence, that they scruple not to claim as their
hereditary right, those lands which are held under lease, or at
will, on condition of planting, or by any other title, even
although indemnity had been publicly secured on oath to the
tenant by the lord proprietor of the soil.&nbsp; Hence arise
suits and contentions, murders and conflagrations, and frequent
fratricides, increased, perhaps, by the ancient national custom
of brothers dividing their property amongst each other.&nbsp;
Another heavy grievance also prevails; the princes entrust the
education of their children to the care of the principal <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>men of
their country, each of whom, after the death of his father,
endeavours, by every possible means, to exalt his own charge
above his neighbours.&nbsp; From which cause great disturbances
have frequently arisen amongst brothers, and terminated in the
most cruel and unjust murders; and on which account friendships
are found to be more sincere between foster-brothers, than
between those who are connected by the natural ties of
brotherhood.&nbsp; It is also remarkable, that brothers shew more
affection to one another when dead, than when living; for they
persecute the living even unto death, but revenge the deceased
with all their power.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THEIR GREAT EXACTION, AND WANT OF
MODERATION</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Where</span> they find plenty, and can
exercise their power, they levy the most unjust exactions.&nbsp;
Immoderate in their love of food and intoxicating drink, they say
with the Apostle, &ldquo;We are instructed both to abound, and to
suffer need;&rdquo; but do not add with him, &ldquo;becoming all
things to all men, that I might by all means save
some.&rdquo;&nbsp; As in times of scarcity their abstinence and
parsimony are too severe, so, when seated at another man&rsquo;s
table, after a long fasting, (like wolves and eagles, who, like
them, live by plunder, and are rarely satisfied,) their appetite
is immoderate.&nbsp; They are therefore penurious in times of
scarcity, and extravagant in times of plenty; but no man, as in
England, mortgages his property for the gluttonous gratification
of his own appetite.&nbsp; They wish, however, that all people
would join with them in their bad habits and expenses; as the
commission of crimes reduces to a level all those who are
concerned in the perpetration of them.</p>
<h3><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CONCERNING THE CRIME OF INCEST, AND THE
ABUSE OF CHURCHES BY SUCCESSION AND PARTICIPATION</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> crime of incest hath so much
prevailed, not only among the higher, but among the lower orders
of this people, that, not having the fear of God before their
eyes, they are not ashamed of intermarrying with their relations,
even in the third degree of consanguinity.&nbsp; They generally
abuse these dispensations with a view of appeasing those enmities
which so often subsist between them, because &ldquo;their feet
are swift to shed blood;&rdquo; and from their love of high
descent, which they so ardently affect and covet, they unite
themselves to their own people, refusing to intermarry with
strangers, and arrogantly presuming on their own superiority of
blood and family.&nbsp; They do not engage in marriage, until
they have tried, by previous cohabitation, the disposition, and
particularly the fecundity, of the person with whom they are
engaged.&nbsp; An ancient custom also prevails of hiring girls
from their parents at a certain price, and a stipulated penalty,
in case of relinquishing their connection.</p>
<p>Their churches have almost as many parsons and sharers as
there are principal men in the parish.&nbsp; The sons, after the
decease of their fathers, succeed to the ecclesiastical
benefices, not by election, but by hereditary right possessing
and polluting the sanctuary of God.&nbsp; And if a prelate should
by chance presume to appoint or institute any other person, the
people would certainly revenge the injury upon the institutor and
the instituted.&nbsp; With respect to these two excesses of
incest and succession, which took root formerly in Armorica, and
are not yet eradicated, Ildebert, bishop of Le Mans, in one of
his epistles, says, &ldquo;that he was <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>present
with a British priest at a council summoned with a view of
putting an end to the enormities of this nation:&rdquo; hence it
appears that these vices have for a long time prevailed both in
Britany and Britain.&nbsp; The words of the Psalmist may not
inaptly be applied to them; &ldquo;They are corrupt and become
abominable in their doings, there is none that doeth good, no,
not one: they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether
become abominable,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THEIR SINS, AND THE CONSEQUENT LOSS OF
BRITAIN AND OF TROY</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Moreover</span>, through their sins, and
particularly that detestable and wicked vice of Sodom, as well as
by divine vengeance, they lost Britain as they formerly lost
Troy.&nbsp; For we read in the Roman history, that the emperor
Constantine having resigned the city and the Western empire to
the blessed Sylvester and his successors, with an intention of
rebuilding Troy, and there establishing the chief seat of the
Eastern Empire, heard a voice, saying, &ldquo;Dost thou go to
rebuild Sodom?&rdquo; upon which, he altered his intention,
turned his ships and standards towards Byzantium, and there
fixing his seat of empire, gave his own propitious name to the
city.&nbsp; The British history informs us, that Mailgon, king of
the Britons, and many others, were addicted to this vice; that
enormity, however, had entirely ceased for so long a time, that
the recollection of it was nearly worn out.&nbsp; But since that,
as if the time of repentance was almost expired, and because the
nation, by its warlike successes and acquisition of territory,
has in our times unusually increased in population and strength,
they boast in their turn, and most confidently and unanimously
affirm, that in a <a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>short time their countrymen shall return to the island,
and, according to the prophecies of Merlin, the nation, and even
the name, of foreigners, shall be extinguished in the island, and
the Britons shall exult again in their ancient name and
privileges.&nbsp; But to me it appears far otherwise; for
since</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Luxuriant animi rebus plerumque
secundis,<br />
Nec facile est &aelig;qua commoda mente pati;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And because</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Non habet unde suum paupertas pascat
amorem, . . .<br />
Divitiis alitur luxuriosus amor.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that their abstinence from that vice, which in their
prosperity they could not resist, may be attributed more justly
to their poverty and state of exile than to their sense of
virtue.&nbsp; For they cannot be said to have repented, when we
see them involved in such an abyss of vices, perjury, theft,
robbery, rapine, murders, fratricides, adultery, and incest, and
become every day more entangled and ensnared in evil-doing; so
that the words of the prophet Hosea may be truly applied to them,
&ldquo;There is no truth, nor mercy,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>Other matters of which they boast are more properly to be
attributed to the diligence and activity of the Norman kings than
to their own merits or power.&nbsp; For previous to the coming of
the Normans, when the English kings contented themselves with the
sovereignty of Britain alone, and employed their whole military
force in the subjugation of this people, they almost wholly
extirpated them; as did king Offa, who by a long and extensive
dyke separated the British from the English; Ethelfrid also, who
demolished the noble city of Legions, <a
name="citation197"></a><a href="#footnote197"
class="citation">[197]</a> and put to death the monks of the
celebrated monastery at Banchor, who had been called in to
promote the success of the Britons by their prayers; and lastly
Harold, who himself on foot, with an army of light-armed
infantry, and conforming to the customary diet of the <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>country, so
bravely penetrated through every part of Wales, that he scarcely
left a man alive in it; and as a memorial of his signal victories
many stones may be found in Wales bearing this
inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="GutSmall">HIC VICTOR FUIT
HAROLDUS</span>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Here
harold conquered</span>.&rdquo; <a name="citation198"></a><a
href="#footnote198" class="citation">[198]</a></p>
<p>To these bloody and recent victories of the English may be
attributed the peaceable state of Wales during the reigns of the
three first Norman kings; when the nation increased in
population, and being taught the use of arms and the management
of horses by the English and Normans (with whom they had much
intercourse, by following the court, or by being sent as
hostages), took advantage of the necessary attention which the
three succeeding kings were obliged to pay to their foreign
possessions, and once more lifting up their crests, recovered
their lands, and spurned the yoke that had formerly been imposed
upon them.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">IN WHAT MANNER THIS NATION IS TO BE
OVERCOME</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> prince who would wish to subdue
this nation, and govern it peaceably, must use this method.&nbsp;
He must be determined to apply a diligent and constant attention
to this purpose for one year at least; for a people who with a
collected force will not openly attack the enemy in the field,
nor wait to be besieged in castles, is not to be overcome at the
first onset, but to be worn out by prudent delay and
patience.&nbsp; Let him divide their strength, and by bribes and
promises endeavour to stir up one against the other, knowing the
spirit of hatred and envy <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>which generally prevails amongst
them; and in the autumn let not only the marches, but also the
interior part of the country be strongly fortified with castles,
provisions, and confidential families.&nbsp; In the meantime the
purchase of corn, cloth, and salt, with which they are usually
supplied from England, should be strictly interdicted; and
well-manned ships placed as a guard on the coast, to prevent
their importation of these articles from Ireland or the Severn
sea, and to facilitate the supply of his own army.&nbsp;
Afterwards, when the severity of winter approaches, when the
trees are void of leaves, and the mountains no longer afford
pasturage&mdash;when they are deprived of any hopes of plunder,
and harassed on every side by the repeated attacks of the
enemy&mdash;let a body of light-armed infantry penetrate into
their woody and mountainous retreats, and let these troops be
supported and relieved by others; and thus by frequent changes,
and replacing the men who are either fatigued or slain in battle,
this nation may be ultimately subdued; nor can it be overcome
without the above precautions, nor without great danger and loss
of men.&nbsp; Though many of the English hired troops may perish
in a day of battle, money will procure as many or more on the
morrow for the same service; but to the Welsh, who have neither
foreign nor stipendiary troops, the loss is for the time
irreparable.&nbsp; In these matters, therefore, as an artificer
is to be trusted in his trade, so attention is to be paid to the
counsel of those who, having been long conversant in similar
concerns, are become acquainted with the manners and customs of
their country, and whom it greatly interests, that an enemy, for
whom during long and frequent conflicts they have contracted an
implacable hatred, should by their assistance be either weakened
or destroyed.&nbsp; Happy should I have termed the borders of
Wales inhabited by the English, if their kings, in the government
of these parts, and in their military operations against the
enemy, had rather employed the marchers and barons of the
country, than adopted the <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>counsels and policy of the people of
Anjou and the Normans.&nbsp; In this, as well as in every other
military expedition, either in Ireland or in Wales, the natives
of the marches, from the constant state of warfare in which they
are engaged, and whose manners are formed from the habits of war,
are bold and active, skilful on horseback, quick on foot, not
nice as to their diet, and ever prepared when necessity requires
to abstain both from corn and wine.&nbsp; By such men were the
first hostile attacks made upon Wales as well as Ireland, and by
such men alone can their final conquest be accomplished.&nbsp;
For the Flemings, Normans, Coterells, and Bragmans, are good and
well-disciplined soldiers in their own country; but the Gallic
soldiery is known to differ much from the Welsh and Irish.&nbsp;
In their country the battle is on level, here on rough ground;
there in an open field, here in forests; there they consider
their armour as an honour, here as a burden; there soldiers are
taken prisoners, here they are beheaded; there they are ransomed,
here they are put to death.&nbsp; Where, therefore, the armies
engage in a flat country, a heavy and complex armour, made of
cloth and iron, both protects and decorates the soldier; but when
the engagement is in narrow defiles, in woods or marshes, where
the infantry have the advantage over the cavalry, a light armour
is preferable.&nbsp; For light arms afford sufficient protection
against unarmed men, by whom victory is either lost or won at the
first onset; where it is necessary that an active and retreating
enemy should be overcome by a certain proportional quantity of
moderate armour; whereas with a more complex sort, and with high
and curved saddles, it is difficult to dismount, more so to
mount, and with the greatest difficulty can such troops march, if
required, with the infantry.&nbsp; In order, therefore, that</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Singula
qu&aelig;que locum teneant sortita decenter,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we maintain it is necessary to employ heavy-armed and strong
troops against men heavily armed, depending <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>entirely
upon their natural strength, and accustomed to fight in an open
plain; but against light-armed and active troops, who prefer
rough ground, men accustomed to such conflicts, and armed in a
similar manner, must be employed.&nbsp; But let the cities and
fortresses on the Severn, and the whole territory on its western
banks towards Wales, occupied by the English, as well as the
provinces of Shropshire and Cheshire, which are protected by
powerful armies, or by any other special privileges and
honourable independence, rejoice in the provident bounty of their
prince.&nbsp; There should be a yearly examination of the warlike
stores, of the arms, and horses, by good and discreet men deputed
for that purpose, and who, not intent on its plunder and ruin,
interest themselves in the defence and protection of their
country.&nbsp; By these salutary measures, the soldiers,
citizens, and the whole mass of the people, being instructed and
accustomed to the use of arms, liberty may be opposed by liberty,
and pride be checked by pride.&nbsp; For the Welsh, who are
neither worn out by laborious burdens, nor molested by the
exactions of their lords, are ever prompt to avenge an
injury.&nbsp; Hence arise their distinguished bravery in the
defence of their country; hence their readiness to take up arms
and to rebel.&nbsp; Nothing so much excites, encourages, and
invites the hearts of men to probity as the cheerfulness of
liberty; nothing so much dejects and dispirits them as the
oppression of servitude.&nbsp; This portion of the kingdom,
protected by arms and courage, might be of great use to the
prince, not only in these or the adjacent parts, but, if
necessity required, in more remote regions; and although the
public treasury might receive a smaller annual revenue from these
provinces, yet the deficiency would be abundantly compensated by
the peace of the kingdom and the honour of its sovereign;
especially as the heavy and dangerous expenses of one military
expedition into Wales usually amount to the whole income among
from the revenues of the province.</p>
<h3><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">IN WHAT MANNER WALES, WHEN CONQUERED,
SHOULD BE GOVERNED</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> therefore this nation is to be
subdued by resolution in the manner proposed, so when subdued,
its government must be directed by moderation, according to the
following plan.&nbsp; Let the care of it be committed to a man of
a firm and determined mind; who during the time of peace, by
paying due obedience to the laws, and respect to the government,
may render it firm and stable.&nbsp; For like other nations in a
barbarous state, this people, although they are strangers to the
principles of honour, yet above all things desire to be honoured;
and approve and respect in others that truth which they
themselves do not profess.&nbsp; Whenever the natural inconstancy
of their indisposition shall induce them to revolt, let
punishment instantly follow the offence; but when they shall have
submitted themselves again to order, and made proper amends for
their faults (as it is the custom of bad men to remember wrath
after quarrels), let their former transgression be overlooked,
and let them enjoy security and respect, as long as they continue
faithful.&nbsp; Thus, by mild treatment they will be invited to
obedience and the love of peace, and the thought of certain
punishment will deter them from rash attempts.&nbsp; We have
often observed persons who, confounding these matters, by
complaining of faults, depressing for services, flattering in
war, plundering in peace, despoiling the weak, paying respect to
revolters, by thus rendering all things confused, have at length
been confounded themselves.&nbsp; Besides, as circumstances which
are foreseen do less mischief, and as that state is happy which
thinks of war in the time of peace, let the wise man be upon his
guard, and prepared against the approaching <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>inconveniences of war, by the construction of forts,
the widening of passes through woods, and the providing of a
trusty household.&nbsp; For those who are cherished and sustained
during the time of peace, are more ready to come forward in times
of danger, and are more confidently to be depended upon; and as a
nation unsubdued ever meditates plots under the disguise of
friendship, let not the prince or his governor entrust the
protection of his camp or capital to their fidelity.&nbsp; By the
examples of many remarkable men, some of whom have been cruelly
put to death, and others deprived of their castles and dignities,
through their own neglect and want of care, we may see, that the
artifices of a crafty and subdued nation are much more to be
dreaded than their open warfare; their good-will than their
anger, their honey than their gall, their malice than their
attack, their treachery than their aggression, and their
pretended friendship more than their open enmity.&nbsp; A prudent
and provident man therefore should contemplate in the misfortune
of others what he ought himself to avoid; correction taught by
example is harmless, as Ennodius <a name="citation203"></a><a
href="#footnote203" class="citation">[203]</a> says: &ldquo;The
ruin of predecessors instructs those who succeed; and a former
miscarriage becomes a future caution.&rdquo;&nbsp; If a
well-disposed prince should wish these great designs to be
accomplished without the effusion of blood, the marches, as we
before mentioned, must be put into a state of defence on all
sides, and all intercourse by sea and land interdicted; some of
the Welsh may be stirred up to deadly feuds, by means of
stipends, and by transferring the property of one person to
another; and thus worn out with hunger, and a want of the
necessaries of life, and harassed by frequent murders and
implacable enmities, they will at last be compelled to
surrender.</p>
<p>There are three things which ruin this nation, and prevent its
enjoying the satisfaction of a fruitful progeny.&nbsp; <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>First,
because both the natural and legitimate sons endeavour to divide
the paternal inheritance amongst themselves; from which cause, as
we have before observed, continual fratricides take place.&nbsp;
Secondly, because the education of their sons is committed to the
care of the high-born people of the country, who, on the death of
their fathers, endeavour by all possible means to exalt their
pupil; from whence arise murders, conflagrations, and almost a
total destruction of the country.&nbsp; And, thirdly, because
from the pride and obstinacy of their disposition, they will not
(like other nations) subject themselves to the dominion of one
lord and king.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="GutSmall">IN WHAT MANNER THIS NATION MAY RESIST AND
REVOLT</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> hitherto so partially and
elaborately spoken in favour of the English, and being equally
connected by birth with each nation, justice demands that we
should argue on both sides; let us therefore, at the close of our
work, turn our attention towards the Welsh, and briefly, but
effectually, instruct them in the art of resistance.&nbsp; If the
Welsh were more commonly accustomed to the Gallic mode of arming,
and depended more on steady fighting than on their agility; if
their princes were unanimous and inseparable in their defence; or
rather, if they had only one prince, and that a good one; this
nation situated in so powerful, strong, and inaccessible a
country, could hardly ever be completely overcome.&nbsp; If,
therefore, they would be inseparable, they would become
insuperable, being assisted by these three circumstances; a
country well defended by nature, a people both contented and
accustomed to live upon <a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>little, a community whose nobles as
well as privates are instructed in the use of arms; and
especially as the English fight for power, the Welsh for liberty;
the one to procure gain, the other to avoid loss; the English
hirelings for money, the Welsh patriots for their country.&nbsp;
The English, I say, fight in order to expel the natural
inhabitants from the island, and secure to themselves the
possession of the whole; but the Welsh maintain the conflict,
that they, who have so long enjoyed the sovereignty of the whole
kingdom, may at least find a hiding place in the worst corner of
it, amongst woods and marshes; and, banished, as it were, for
their offences, may there in a state of poverty, for a limited
time, perform penance for the excesses they committed in the days
of their prosperity.&nbsp; For the perpetual remembrance of their
former greatness, the recollection of their Trojan descent, and
the high and continued majesty of the kingdom of Britain, may
draw forth many a latent spark of animosity, and encourage the
daring spirit of rebellion.&nbsp; Hence during the military
expedition which king Henry II. made in our days against South
Wales, an old Welshman at Pencadair, who had faithfully adhered
to him, being desired to give his opinion about the royal army,
and whether he thought that of the rebels would make resistance,
and what would be the final event of this war, replied,
&ldquo;This nation, O king, may now, as in former times, be
harassed, and in a great measure weakened and destroyed by your
and other powers, and it will often prevail by its laudable
exertions; but it can never be totally subdued through the wrath
of man, unless the wrath of God shall concur.&nbsp; Nor do I
think, that any other nation than this of Wales, or any other
language, whatever may hereafter come to pass, shall, in the day
of severe examination before the Supreme Judge, answer for this
corner of the earth.&rdquo;</p>

are to understand the Snowdonian range of hills, our author has
not been quite accurate in fixing the source of the river Dovy,

river, from which Barmouth derives the name of Abermaw, and to
which Giraldus, in the fifth chapter of the second book of his
Itinerary, has given the epithet of <i>bifurcus</i>, runs far to
the southward of either of the Traeths.&nbsp; The Traeth Mawr, or
large sands, are formed by the impetuous torrents which descend
from Snowdon by Beddgelert, and pass under the Devil&rsquo;s
Bridge at Pont Aberglasllyn, so called from the river Glasllyn;
and the Traeth Bychan, or little sands, are formed by numerous

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
